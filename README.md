# My personal website

I decided to host all my files from my website here just in case the VPS (virtual private server) hired fails to ensure the codes.

I intend to exhibit my learning in web development. It means all you see in this repository was made completely by me.

You may find some picture files (nothing a minor shouldn't see in the internet) that really appears in my site.

The address is 140.82.27.108, in case you're curious to see what it's like.

I may share some articles too, in order to show I can talk about other stuff.

The background image is the index.php code opened in Atom (a pretty good IDE to manage many files)

What I've already done:
- navigation bar with dropdown links
- god moving (Articles > Religion)
- Cunha's interview in .gif (Articles > Politics)
- a color palette in Canvas (not up yet)

Coming soon:
- CSV to images
- finantial graphics in Canvas 
- MySQL database with market data got from BM&FBovespa's (Brazilian stock exchange) FTP website: ftp://ftp.bmf.com.br/MarketData/, making a public MySQL account available for SELECT queries (of course, limiting the resources, so I don't get f*d up by an anonymous creepy guy)
  - maybe updating this database daily

In the future:
- a chatting (only text) script written in Python, which server will be inside my VPS (I guess, probably using websocket - I gotta learn that first)

One day, who knows:
- get a real job in IT
